This project consists of two Python files, each implementing a different approach to finding the Minimum Dominating Set (MDS) in a given graph. The first file implements a greedy algorithm, which follows a heuristic-based approach to iteratively select nodes that maximize coverage while minimizing redundancy, ensuring a fast but potentially suboptimal solution. The second file employs a stochastic local search (SLS) method, which explores the solution space probabilistically by iteratively refining an initial solution through local modifications. This approach balances exploration and exploitation to improve upon the greedy algorithmâ€™s results, often yielding a smaller dominating set. Together, these two implementations allow for a comparative analysis of deterministic and probabilistic methods in solving the MDS problem efficiently.
